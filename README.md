# mygithub
mygithub is about git and github.
Basically, it's a writting on my
working with the two. At first, the learning process
of the two was difficult to comprehend, but after a few 
pretty good YouTube videos on the subject, I caught
on fairly easy.
   Simplilearn, edureka and nerds lesson are the best ones.
There are other ones that are good too.
   Next, it's a good idea to run git as administrator,
so your files are saved automatically to a file system
like dropbox.
    To write code into git, open your code editor.
Give your code a file name in the editor, or 
in the terminal, use the touch command then the
file name. When this is finished, use the git add 
command with the file name.

              example 1
           
           git add <filename>
           
              example 2
              
              git add .
              
The second example is used to add all untracked files.
